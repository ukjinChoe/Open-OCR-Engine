# OCR-Engine

# Overview

Thanks to open source, it's not really difficult to build a customed OCR engine. In this repository, we'll do something below.

1. download and pre-process dataset for training model
2. try training text detection model and text recognization model respectively
3. custom your own OCR-Engine
4. serve your model on web

# Code is getting ready for being uploaded.
> I'm planning to push the first entire codes by end of April.
